# Ban wildcard imports (`import * as something`) from libraries (`readme/no-wildcard-imports`)

üíº This rule is enabled in the following configs: üìÅ `esm`, ‚öõÔ∏è `react`.

```js
import * as dateFns from 'date-fns';
```

```js
/*eslint readme/no-wildcard-imports: ["error", { allow: ['@sentry/node'] }]*/

import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node';
```

## Options

### `allow`

Type: `array`

```js
'readme/no-wildcard-imports': [
  'error',
  {
    allow: ['@sentry/node'],
  }
]
```

You can exempt specific libraries like this:

  },
],
```
